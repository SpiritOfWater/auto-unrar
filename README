== bin/unrar2.pl ==

Smart extracting of RAR archives.

Features:
* extract multipart archives
* handle three multipart archives naming conventions
** .part1.rar, .part2.rar, ...
** .rar, .r00, .r01, ...
** .001, .002, ...
* duplicate directory structure tree 
** respect basedir_deep configuration option
** see http://bit.ly/9N2iSW ( docs/test-data/8-after-before-diff.txt )
* move/rename normal files (no rar archives)
* check minimum free space on device
* can delete archives if extracted ok
* save status to file
** so already extracted archives aren't extracted again
** trying extract again only if some change found
* keypress features during run ( p...pause, c...continue, q...quit )
* good error handling
** sleep (increment time to sleep) and try again
** recovery from error (maintaining finished_ok and undo list)
** revert to initial state if error found during extraction of directory
* can be configured to run periodically (e.g. from cron) to incrementally extract RAR archives
** check if there is any change inside direcotory
* rsync compatibility
** can generate exclude list (basedir_deep configuration option is used)
** check mtime recursively
** respect minimum time since last change (let rsync finish his job)
* preserve mtime of files and directories where possible
* has own test suite
* tested on many big archives
* debug and verbose support

Tested on Linux only. Also see source ToDo list inside source code.
