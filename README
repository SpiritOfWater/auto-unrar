Smart Perl scripts (for Linux and Windows) to auto unrar/extract a directory structure containing many RAR archives.

== bin/unrar2.pl (for Linux) ==

Smart extracting of many RAR archives for Linux.

Features:
* extract multipart archives
* handle all three multipart archives naming conventions
** .part1.rar, .part2.rar, ...
** .rar, .r00, .r01, ...
** .001, .002, ...
* duplicate directory structure tree 
** respect basedir_deep configuration option
** see http://bit.ly/9N2iSW ( docs/test-data/8-after-before-diff.txt )
* move/rename normal files (no rar archives)
* check minimum free space on device
* can delete archives if extracted ok
* save status to file
** so already extracted archives aren't extracted again
** trying extract again only if some change found
* keypress features during run ( p...pause, c...continue, q...quit )
* smart error handling 
** maintain undo actions list for recovery to initial state
** sleep (increment time to sleep) and try again
** revert to initial state if error found during extraction of directory
* can be configured to run periodically (e.g. from cron) to incrementally extract RAR archives
** check if there is any change inside direcotory
* support for rsync integration
** generate rsync exclude list (basedir_deep configuration option is used)
** check time of last modification of base directories (recursively)
** respect minimum time since last change (let rsync finish his job)
* preserve mtime of files and directories where possible
* has own test suite
* tested on many big archives
* debug and verbose support

Tested on Linux only. Also see ToDo list inside source code

== bin/unrar.pl (for Windows) ==

Smart extracting of RAR archives for Windows with password recovery.

Create directories 'extract', 'extracted' and 'extracted-arch' inside 'auto-unrar' directory.
Put your archive tree to 'extract'.
Run 'perl unrar.pl'.
See content of 'extracted' and 'extracted-arch' and not extracted content inside 'extract'.

See example image http://bit.ly/a1hDRD .

Inside 'tests' you can see structure of what you can put to 'extract'.

=== Install ===

Perl should be installed. Try http://strawberryperl.com/ .

git clone git://github.com/mj41/auto-unrar.git auto-unrar
cd auto-unrar
mkdir extract
mkdir extracted
mkdir extract-arch
cpan Term::ReadKey
cpan YAML::Any

=== Run ===

cd auto-unrar/bin
perl unrar.pl

Press:
* P ... pause,
* C .. continue,
* Q .. quit.
